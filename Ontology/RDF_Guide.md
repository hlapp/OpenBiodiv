# OpenBiodiv RDF Guide

This is the Open Biodiversity Knowledge Management System (OpenBiodiv,
formerly known as OBKMS) RDF Guide. The guide is intended to explain to humans
and to define for computers the data model of OpenBiodiv and aid its users in
generating OpenBiodiv-compatible RDF and in creating useful SPARQL queries or
other useful extensions.

This guide is a [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) document.
Literate programming is the act of including source code within documentation.
In usual software development practice the reverse holds true. By virtue of
this programming paradigm the formal description of the data model, i.e. the
[RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) statements that form the ontology and the
vocabularies, are found within the document itself and are extracted from it
with the program `noweb`. `noweb` can be easily obtained for GNU Linux.

## Introduction

TODO: NMF: Include in Guide a Reference section, with a few essential refs. to
connect to relevant prior efforts?

Answer to NMF: I will do this once I start writing the paper.

**Motivation.** The raison d'Ãªtre of the OpenBiodiv Data Model is to enable
the operation of a semantic database as part of OpenBiodiv. The data model
consists of:

1. A formal computer ontology expressed as RDF, called from here on OpenBiodiv
Ontology, introducing the entities that our knowledge base holds and giving
axioms that restrict the ways in which they can be combined.

2. Formal vocabularies specified in RDF for particular application areas.

2. Natural language descriptions of the meaning (semantics) of the concepts
from (1) and (2) in our conceptualization of the universe of discourse.

3. Examples and recommendations that illustrate and describe the intended
model to human users as the formal ontology necessarily will be more lax than
the intended model.

Viewing the data model from another angle it

(a) describes a view of the universe of discourse (biodiversity information),
which we call conceptualization, and

(b) introduces a formal way to store biodiversity information in a database.

We do not believe other data providers ought to use the same formal way to
store biodiversity information in their databases, as they might be using a
different database application, or even paradigm. However, we do believe that
should information exchange between OpenBiodiv and these other data providers
occur, biodiversity information ought to at least follow the same conceptual
model presented herein.

For a discussion see
[Specification of Conceptualization](https://www.obitko.com/tutorials/ontologies-semantic-web/specification-of-conceptualization.html), as well as the article by
[Guarino et al. (2009)](http://iaoa.org/isc2012/docs/Guarino2009_What_is_an_Ontology.pdf).

**Def. (OpenBiodiv Ontology):** In the following code-chunk that will be
extracted by `notangle` (you can use the `Makefile` for this purpose), the
top-level structure of the ontology is defined:

```
<<OpenBiodiv Ontology>>=

<<Prefixes>>
<<Ontology Metadata>>
<<Model of the Publishing Domain>>
<<Model of Biological Systematics>>
<<Vocabulary of Taxonomic Statuses>>
<<Vocabulary of RCC5 Terms>>
<<Borrowed Parts from External Ontology>>
@
```

**Def. (Ontology Metadata):**

```
<<Ontology Metadata>>=

: rdf:type owl:Ontology ;
  owl:versionInfo "0.3" ;
  rdfs:comment "Open Biodiversity Knowledge Management System Ontology" ;
  dc:title "OpenBiodiv Ontology" ;
  dc:subject "OpenBiodiv Ontology" ;
  rdfs:label "OpenBiodiv Ontology" ;
  dc:creator "Viktor Senderov, Terry Catapano, Kiril Simov, Lyubomir Penev" ;
  dc:rights "CCBY" ;
  owl:imports <http://phylodiversity.net/dsw/dsw.rdf> ;
  owl:imports <http://www.essepuntato.it/2008/12/pattern> ;
  owl:imports <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/> .

@
```

**Note:** The code snipped above, `Ontology Metadata`, is called a *chunk*. In
the `noweb` way of doing literate programming, we write our source code in chunks.
Each chunk has a name that is found between the &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; and ends in `@`. Chunks can contain other
chunks and thus the writing of the source code becomes hierarchical and non-
linear. In this root chunk, we've listed other chunks that we'll introduce
later and some verbatim code. In order to create the ontology we use the
`notangle` command from `noweb`.


**Command to extract the Core Ontology.**

```
notangle -R"OpenBiodiv Ontology" RDF_Guide.md > OpenbBodiv.ttl
```

**Examples.** This document also contains some examples.

```
<<Examples>>=

 #' These are the examples for the OpenBiodiv data model.
@
```

**Command to build the examples.** 

```
notangle -RExamples RDF_Guide.md > Examples.ttl
```

TODO: check for prefix consistency for all imported ontologies.


**Incorporated external ontologies.** Our data model is a natural extension of
existing data models. Therefore, we incorporate several external ontologies or
parts of existing ontologies into ours. We try to include these ontologies via
`owl:imports`. Where a URL does not resolve, or we want to import only a specific
subset of an ontology or a specific version, we directly introduce the needed
RDF into our model in the code-chunk `Borrowed Parts from External Ontologies`.
In addition to that we've downloaded the RDF for everything that we've borrowed
in the `imports` sub-subdirectory in case the URL's become unavailable in the
future. There is a catalog of this directory under
[Catalog of imported ontologies](imports/Catalog.md), which is, however,
still a work in progress.

**Prefixes.** In OpenBiodiv prefixes are stored in a YAML configuration file
called

[`prefix_db.yml`](../R/obkms/inst/prefix_db.yml)

The following Turtle code can be extracted from the prefix database with
`obkms::prefix_ttl()` command:

```
<<Prefixes>>=

**Types of entities that OpenBiodiv manages.** There are two ways to look at
the types of entities that OpenBiodiv manages. The first way is to look at the
application domain. OpenBiodiv's application domain is the semantic publishing
of taxonomic, systematic, biodiversity, genomic, ecologic, and related
information. Therefore, the entities that OpenBiodiv manages are separated
across these domains.

Another way to look at the entities that OpenBiodiv manages is the structural
way. As the main sources of information for OpenBiodiv are scientific
articles, we can separate the entities that are extracted in entities that
are structural parts of the articles such as articles, paragraphs, sections,
tables, figures, etc., and entities that are talked about -- the actual
(domain-specific) information contained in the articles.

Both ways of looking at the entities are compatible with each other. The
following information should probably go into "OpenBiodiv Extension and
Linking Guide" but for the sake of completeness we will present it here, as
well.

Entity extraction from taxonomic articles can happen in two phases:

1. Conversion of XML elements into RDF triples following the structure of the
XML. In this stage, key XML elements are transformed into bibliographic
elements. E.g., XML elements denoting sections become `doco:Section`'s, figures
become `doco:Figure`'s, etc. Here no information extraction is taking place
and no additional semantics are added. This step can be completed linearly
without any external lookups. Key here is that the XML-hierachy is preserved
in RDF via, for example, `po:contains`.

2. Named entity recognition, co-referencing, and named entity identification.
During this step, non-structural entities are extracted from the information
present in the structural elements in the form of text or attributes. The details of how this done are beyond
the scope of this guide but it is important to note that an attempt is made to
coreference -- i.e. match multiple bibliographic elements to the same non-
bibliographic entity, if they do in fact refer to the same entity in the sense
of Frege's semiotic triangle. Another attempt is made to properly manage
identifiers. This stage cannot be completed without external look-ups.

TODO NMF: Or Peirce's ? https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/peirce-semiotics/

Answer: I am not immediately familiar with the work of Pierce, but I am adding
it to my reading list.

**Note on Capitalization.** Our ontology strives be a formal specification of
a conceptualization. In our mental model we have some concepts of some things.
When we talk about these concepts in the abstract, we will make use of
Capitalization. For example let's suppose we want to name the top-level
concept, i.e. the concept which encompasses all  concepts. For this we write
Thing. In another example, let's suppose we want to name a part of a
manuscript where taxon circumscription takes place. We say Treatment when we
refer to that concept. We also have concepts for relations (in our
conceptualization only binary relations are allowed). To denote these
relations in the abstract we use verbal phrases and we might or might not use
quotes (we will use quotes only if it adds to the clarity of exposition). For
example, Treatment is a Thing as opposed to Treatment "is a" Thing. We also
have individual instances of these concepts. To refer to those we might use
improper or proper nouns or phrases wherever appropriate. For example, "the
treatment on page 5," or "a treatment," or "John."

When we formally define a concept in OWL and issue an URI to it, we shall
refer to the URI, as we refer to all URI's in the text with `typewriter font`.
URI's of classes and vocabularies will be in `MajorCamelCase`. URI's of
relationships will be in `minorCamelCase`. URI's of individuals `will-be-hyphenated`.
This seems to generally in accordance with WWW practice.

## RDF Model

### The Publishing Domain

The publishing domain is described in our model using the Semantic Publishing
and Referencing Ontologies, a.k.a. [SPAR Ontologies](http://www.sparontologies.net/).
We do import several of these ontologies (please consult the paragraph
"Incorporated external ontologies"). Refer to the documentation on the SPAR
Ontologies' site for an exhaustive treatment.

In the rest of this section we describe the modeling of entities in the
publishing domain that are *not found* in the SPAR ontologies. The central new
class in OpenBiodiv not found in SPAR is the `trt:Treatment` class, borrowed
from the [Treatment Ontologies](https://github.com/plazi/TreatmentOntologies).

#### Changes to SPAR

We have mentioned before that when we extract bibliographic elements from the XML,
we make use of the `po:contains` SPAR property. For example, an article can 
`po:contain` a secion and this section can `po:contain` another (sub-)section.
In our view, this means that also the article contains the (sub-)section. Thefore
we define `po:contains` as a transitive property.

**Def. ('contains'):**
```

<<Model of the Publishing Domain>>=

po:contains rdf:type owl:TransitiveProperty .
@
```

#### Article Metadata

The main objects of information extraction and retrieval of OpenBiodiv in the
first stage of its development are scientific journal articles from the
journals [Biodiversity Data Journal](http://bdj.pensoft.net/) and
[ZooKeys](http://zookeys.pensoft.net/) and other Pensoft journals.
We model the bibliographic objects around Journal Article, such as Publisher,
and Journal using SPAR.

**Example:**

```
<<Examples>>=

:biodiversity-data-journal rdf:type fabio:Journal ;
  skos:prefLabel "Biodiversity Data Journal" ;
  skos:altLabel  "BDJ" ;
  <http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/issn>     "1314-2836" ;
  <http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/basic/2.0/eIssn>    "1314-2828" ;
  dcterms:publisher "Pensoft Publishers" ;
  frbr:part <http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.4.e10095> . 

<http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.4.e10095> a fabio:JournalArticle ;
  skos:prefLabel "10.3897/BDJ.4.e10095" ;
  prism:doi "10.3897/BDJ.4.e10095" ;
  fabio:hasPublicationYear "2016"^^xsd:gYear ;
  dcterms:title "A new spider species, Heser stoevi sp. nov., from Turkmenistan (Araneae: Gnaphosidae)"@en .

:pensoft-publishers rdf:type foaf:Agent ;
  skos:prefLabel "Pensoft Publishers" ;
  pro:holdsRoleInTime :pensoft-publishes-bdj . 

:pensoft-publishes-bdj rdf:type pro:RoleInTime ;
  pro:relatesToDocument :biodiversity-data-journal . 
@
```

TODO: keywords

Note that in this example `:biodiversity-data-journal` is non-structural
entity, as it doesn't denote part of the manuscript, but rather something
external, i.e. a journal. This means that creating it, requires of the step of
named entity identification.

#### Taxonomic Treatment

See [Plazi](http://plazi.org/) for a theoretical discussion of Treatment.

TODO: NMF: Is that deliberately about application domain, or structural perspective, or both? Does it matter that you clarify this? (maybe not, I just want you to consider..)

Answer: most structural elements are defined in the publishing domain. However,
not everything here is a structural element.

**Def. (Treatment):** *Taxonomic Treatment, or simply Treatment, is
a rhetorical element of a taxonomic publication:*

```
<<Model of the Publishing Domain>>=

trt:Treatment a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:label "Taxonomic Treatment"@en ;
  rdfs:label "Taxonomische Abhandlung"@de ;
  rdfs:label "Ð¢Ð°ÐºÑÐ¾Ð½Ð¾Ð¼Ð¸ÑÐ½Ð¾ Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑÐ½ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ðµ"@bg ;
  rdfs:comment "A taxonomic treatment, or simply a treatment, is a 
                rhetorical element of a taxonomic publication, i.e. a 
                specialized section, where taxon circumscription  
                takes place."@en ;
  rdfs:comment "Eine taxonomische Abhandlung, oder nur Abhandlung, ist 
                ein rhetorisches Element eines wissenschaftlichen 
                taxomischen Artikels, d.h. ein spezialisierter Abschnitt,
                wo die Umschreibung eines taxonomischen Konzeptes
                stattfindet."@de ;
  rdfs:comment "Ð¢Ð°ÐºÑÐ¾Ð½Ð¾Ð¼Ð¸ÑÐ½Ð¾ Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑÐ½ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ðµ Ð¸Ð»Ð¸ ÑÐ°Ð¼Ð¾ ÐÐ¾ÑÑÐ½ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ðµ Ðµ ÑÐ¸ÑÐ¾ÑÑÐ½Ð° ÑÐ°ÑÑ
                Ð¾Ñ ÑÐ°ÐºÑÐ¾Ð½Ð¾Ð¼Ð¸ÑÐ½Ð°ÑÐ° ÑÑÐ°ÑÐ¸Ñ, ÐºÑÐ´ÐµÑÐ¾ ÑÐµ ÑÐ»ÑÑÐ²Ð° Ð¾Ð¿Ð¸ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÐµÑÐ¾
                Ð½Ð° Ð´Ð°Ð´ÐµÐ½Ð° ÑÐ°ÐºÑÐ¾Ð½Ð¾Ð¼Ð¸ÑÐ½Ð° ÐºÐ¾Ð½ÑÐµÐ¿ÑÐ¸Ñ."@bg ;                  
  rdfs:subClassOf deo:DiscourseElement .
@
```

Thus, Treatment is defined akin to Introduction, Methods, etc. from

[DEO, The Discourse Elements Ontology](http://www.sparontologies.net/ontologies/deo/source.html).

**Example:** In this example, we show how to instantiate a treatment:

```
<<Examples>>=

:heser-stoevi-treatment
  a doco:Section, trt:Treatment .
@
```

Note that we type `:treatment` both as `trt:Treatment` (i.e. the rhetorical
element Treatment) and as s `doco:Section` because we view this particular
treatment to also be a structural section of the document.

**Example:** In this example we show how different sub-article elements such as treatments
are linked via the use of the `po:contains`:

```
<<Examples>>=

<http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.4.e10095> po:contains :heser-stoevi-treatment . 
@
```

##### Taxonomic Nomenclature Section

**Def. (Nomenclature):** A taxonomic nomenclature section, or simply a
nomenclature, is a rhetorical element of a taxonomic publication where
nomenclatural acts are published and nomenclatural statements are made.
Nomenclature is a subsection of Treatment.

```
<<Model of the Publishing Domain>>=

trt:Nomenclature a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf deo:DiscourseElement ,
                  [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
                    owl:onProperty po:isContainedBy ;
                    owl:someValuesFrom trt:Treatment ] ;
  rdfs:label "Taxonomic Nomenclature Section"@en ;
  rdfs:comment "A taxonomic nomenclature section, or simply a
nomenclature, is a rhetorical element of a taxonomic publication where
nomenclatural acts are published and nomenclatural statements are made.
Nomenclature is a subsection of Treatment."@en .

trt:NomenclatureHeading a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf deo:DiscourseElement ,
                  [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
                    owl:onProperty po:isContainedBy ;
                    owl:someValuesFrom trt:Nomenclature ] ;
                  rdfs:label "Treatment Title"@en ;
  rdfs:comment "Inside the taxonomic nomenclature section, we have the treatment title."@en .

trt:NomenclatureCitationList a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf deo:DiscourseElement ,
                  [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
                    owl:onProperty po:isContainedBy ;
                    owl:someValuesFrom trt:Nomenclature ] ;
                  rdfs:label "Taxonomic Nomenclature Citation List"@en ;
  rdfs:comment "Inside the taxonomic nomenclature section, we have a list
                of citations."@en .                  
@
```

**Example:** In this example, we show how to define a nomenclature section:

```
<<Examples>>=

:heser-stoevi-treatment
  po:contains :heser-stoevi-nomenclature .

:heser-stoevi-nomenclature a doco:Section, trt:Nomenclature ;
  po:contains :heser-stoevi-nomenclature-heading .

:heser-stoevi-nomenclature-heading a trt:NomenclatureHeading ;
  cnt:chars 
  "Heser stoevi urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:E4D7D5A0-D649-4F5E-9360-D0488D73EEE8 Deltshev sp. n." .
@
```

TODO: All the other subsections of trt:Treatment, Description, etc.

#### Taxonomic Name Usage

In the text of taxonomic articles we find strings like "*Heser stoevi*
Deltschev, sp. n.". In our conceptualization these are called *taxonomic name
usages* (TNU's) as they refer to  published scientific names from the domain
of biological systematics. The taxonomic name usage consists of three parts:

1. Taxonomic name: one or more words identifying the taxon (a purported
evolutionary entity in nature). These can be Latinized or take the form of an
identifier.

2. Taxonomic name author. The name-and-year of the author(s) of the taxonomic name.

3. Taxonomic name status containing information about the type of the taxonomic
name usage.

In the example, "*Heser stoevi*" is the binomial Latinized species name,
"Deltschev" is the name of the person who newly coined the name describing the
taxon , and "sp. n." bears taxonomic (and nomenclatural) information
indicating that this is a species new to science.

Modeling-wise, we consider TNU's to be specialized instances of `pext:Mention`
from the [PROTON Extensions module](http://ontotext.com/proton/). Furthermore,
we link the TNU's to the scientific name they are symbolizing via
`pkm:mentions`.

**Def. (Taxonomic Name Usage):** *A taxonomic name usage is the mentioning of
a biological taxonomic name or taxon concept label (see later) in a text,
together with possibly a taxonomic status, bearing further information about
the name:*

```
<<Model of the Publishing Domain>>=

:TaxonomicNameUsage rdf:type owl:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf  pext:Mention ;
  rdfs:comment "A taxonomic name usage is the mentioning of a
biological taxonomic name or taxon concept label in a text."@en ;
  rdfs:label "Taxonomic Name Usage"@en .

dwciri:taxonomicStatus rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ; 
  rdfs:label "taxonomic status"@en ;
  rdfs:comment "the IRI version of the DwC term taxonmic status" .
@

```

**Note:** In the logic of our algorithms, it is very important that TNU's are
dated with `dc:date`.

**Example:** In the following example, we express in RDF a TNU that is in the
nomenclature heading of a treatment (treatment title). Structurally, the TNU
is connected to the containing section via `po:contains`; `cnt:chars` is used
to dump the full string of the usage and DwC properties are used to encode
more granular information in addition to the dump.

In the second step of RDF-ization, we use `dwciri` properties to link the TNU
to semantic entities. `dwciri:taxonomicStatus` is used to link the TNU to an
item in the
[OpenBiodiv Taxonomic Status Vocabulary](#vocabulary-of-taxon-classification).
`:scientificName` is used to link the TNU to the IRI of the name that
the TNU is mentioning. Note, we have introduced `:scientificName` as
a sub-property of `pext:Mention`. In this example it is linked both to local
name and to a remote name. This implies that the names are the same (see Rule
later).

Also, during the second step, the TNU is linked to the reified taxon concept
label *Heser stoevi* sec. 10.3897/BDJ.4.e10095 via `:taxonConceptLabel` as
even though the character content of the TNU does not contain an "according
to" (usually abbreviated as "sec."), we know for certain which concept the
author is invoking as we are in the treatment title (current concept/ *this*
concept).

```

### Biological Taxonomy and Systematics

In this subsection we introduce  classes and properties which are used to
convey information from the domain of biological systematics.



#### Biological Names

In OpenBiodiv, we reify biological names.

In our conceptualization, taxa in nature are things (referents) that are
refered to by our thoughts, theories and concepts (references) that are
labeled or symbolized by by  biological names
([semiotic triangle](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotisches_Dreieck)).

Biological names play a dual role, however, in our system as they are also
concepts, i.e. references of taxonomic name usages. A biological name may
symbolize more than one taxon concept. It is useful to think of biological
names then as taxon concept lineages. More about taxon concepts later.
 
Biological names have been modeled elsewhere such as for example in
[NOMEN](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/nomen). However, NOMEN takes the
approach of using non-human-readable identifiers and only relying on labels to
identify classes of taxonomic names, which does not fit our workflow. For
example, the identifier for the class "biological name" is `NOMEN_0000030`. In
our workflow both RDF generation and debugging would be severely hampered by
this convention. That's why we have defined names in OpenBiodiv and mapped
them to their NOMEN equivalents.

**Def. (Biological Name, Scientific Name, Vernacular Name):** *Biological
Name, Scientific Name, and Vernacular Name are introduced as their NOMEN
equivalents.*

```
<<Model of Biological Systematics>>=

:BiologicalName rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Biological Name"@en ;
    owl:sameAs nomen:NOMEN_0000030 .

:ScientificName rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :BiologicalName ;
    rdfs:label "Scientific Name"@en ;
    owl:sameAs  nomen:NOMEN_0000036 .
    
:VernacularName a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf :BiologicalName ;
  rdfs:label "Vernacular Name"@en ;
  owl:sameAs nomen:NOMEN_0000037 .
@
```

**Def. (Taxon Concept Label):** *We further introduce the class of taxon
concept labels, unknown to NOMEN that is a biological name plus a reference to
its descrition, i.e. it is the label of taxon concept. A taxon concept label
is a taxonomic name usage accompanied by an additional part, consisting of
"sec." + an identifier or a literature reference of a work containing the
expression of a taxon concept (for example a treatment).*

```

We do not model scientific names down to the level of the Codes as NOMEN does.
For example we do not make a distinction between a zoological and a botanical
name. Nothing prevents us, however, from creating derived classes later on.
This means that our model is somewhat cruder but compatible with NOMEN.

For properties of biological names we take a different path from NOMEN. We
also use different sets of properties to define relationships between
biological names and for their data properties.

For data properties we use DwC terms.

To connect different biological objects such as taxon concepts or occurrences
to a scientific name we use `:scientificName`, which is derived from
`dwciri:scientificName`. Even though `dwciri:scientificName` is defined  in
spirit in
<http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/rdf/index.htm#2.5_Terms_in_the_dwciri:_namespace>,

we couldn't actually find a formal definition in RDF, that's why we're
introducing it here together with a super-property to refer to a more broader
class of names.

For relationships between names we introduce two types of relationships:
unidirectional and bidirectional.

**Def. ('has related name'):** *'has related name' is an object property that we
use in order to indicate that two biological names are related somehow. This
relationship is purposely vague as to encompass all situations where two
biological names co-occur in a text. It is transitive and reflexive.*

```
<<Model of Biological Systematics>>=

relationship is purposely vague as to encompass all situations where two

@
```

**Def. (has replacement name):** *This is a uni-directional property. Its meaning
is that one one biological name links to a different biological name via the
usage of this property, then the object of the triple is the form of the
biological name the use of which is more accurate and should be preferred
given the information that system currently holds. This property is only
defined for scientific names.*

##### Now we define some rules for names

**Rule 1 for Names:** *For a scientific name X, if there doesn't exist a TNU
mentioning X, which has the taxon status of `:UnavailableName`, or if there
does exist a TNU Y mentioning X with the status of `:UnavailableName`, but
there also exists a TNU Z mentioning X with a later date than Y, which has the
status of `:AvailableName` or `:ReplacementName`, then X has the taxon status
of `:AvailableName`.*

```
<<Rules>>=

# rules need to be evaluated in the order here
# I. set all names that have not been made unavailabel to available
INSERT {

 # note the date here refers to when was the taxonomic status of the name last determined
 # 2. set all names that were made unavailable at one point to unavailable and copy the
 # date
INSERT {
  ?a dwciri:taxonomicStatus :UnavailableName .
  ?a dc:date ?d .
}
WHERE {

@
```

**Rule 2 for Names:** *For a scientific name X, if it is mentioned in the
heading of a nomenclature section (treatment title) in a TNU Y with status
`:ReplacementName`, then every name Z_i, mentioned in the nomenclatural
citation list in TNU's with status `:UnavailableName` is linked to X via
`:replacementName`.*

```
<<Rules>>=

# II. Link replacement names
INSERT {
    ?a trt:replacementName ?b .
}
WHERE {
	?a a :ScientificName .
	?b a :ScientificName .
	[] a trt:Nomenclature ;
	 	   po:contains [ a :TaxonomicNameUsage ;
	 	   				 pkm:mentions ?a ;
	 	   				 dwciri:taxonomicStatus :ReplacementName ] ,

		      	         dwciri:taxonomicStatus :UnavailableName ].
}
@
```

**Rule 3 for Names:** *All names in the nomenclature section are linked via `:relatedName`.*

```
<<Rules>>=

@
```

**Rule 4 for Names:** *If for a name X, there exists a TNU Y If a TNU is
marked as `:Conserved`, then the name is also marked as `:Conserved`. A
conserved name should not be made `:Unavailable`!*


```
<<Rules>>=

# IV. Conserved names

INSERT {

**Rule 5 for Names:** *If a TNU points to two different names with `dwciri:scientificName`, then
they are the same:*


```
<<Rules>>=

# V. Conserved names

INSERT {
    ?name1 owl:sameAs ?name2 .
}
WHERE {
  ?name1 a :ScientificName .
  ?name2 a :ScientificName .
  ?t a :TaxonomicNameUsage ;
   t dwciri:scientificName ?name1, ?name2 .
  FILTER( ?name1 != ?name2 ) .
@
```

**Example** We go back to the example of  *Heser stoevi*. The meaning of the
date property here is to indicate when was the taxonomic status assumed.

```

#### Taxon Concepts

**Discussion.** Our view of taxon concepts is based on
[Berendsohn (1995)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1222443) and
[Franz et al (2008)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781420008562.ch5).

We consider any given taxon concept to be a scientific theory (concept) about
a class of biological organisms (taxon). The class description, as in "as in
all spiders have spinnerets (silk-producing glands)" (Nico Franz, personal
correspondence), is called *intensional meaning,* whereas the group of
organisms in nature conforming with the intensional meaning is called the
class *extension.*

We want to model both the intensional meaning (which traits do organisms
belonging to a taxon have) and the extension of taxon concepts (which
organisms belong to a taxon) and the extensions being organisms that are
considered to be members of the class.

This necessitates the view that taxon concepts are both instances of a taxon
concept class and are classes of ogranisms. Later, we will show that this
means that we model Taxon Concepts with OWL Full.

OpenBiodiv taxon concepts are instances of `dwc:Taxon` and vice versa (*"A
group of organisms [sic] considered by taxonomists to form a homogeneous
unit."*).

Also, taxon concepts are instances of `frbr:Work` as well, but not vice versa
(*"A distinct intellectual or artistic creation. A work is an abstract entity;
there is no single material object one can point to as the work. We recognize
the work through individual realizations or expressions of the work, but the
work itself exists only in the commonality of content between and among the
various expressions of the work. When we speak of Homer's Iliad as a work, our
point of reference is not a particular recitation or text of the work, but the
intellectual creation that lies behind all the various expressions of the
work."*).

Furthermore, taxon concepts can also be modeled as `skos:Concept`, but not
vice versa (*"A SKOS concept can be viewed as an idea or notion; a unit of
thought. However, what constitutes a unit of thought is subjective, and this
definition is meant to be suggestive, rather than restrictive."*).

All three classes represent a distinctive view that we want to adopt in
modeling different features of taxon concepts.

Holding the views of Berendsohn and of Franz, we require that each taxon
concept is linked to both a biological name and to a work (i.e. publication,
database, etc.), where the circumscription is properly defined.

**Def. (Taxon Concept):**

```
<<Model of Biological Systematics>>=

:TaxonConcept rdf:type owl:Class ;
  owl:equivalentClass dwc:Taxon ;
  rdfs:subClassof frbr:Work , skos:Concept ,
                  [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
                    owl:onProperty :taxonConceptLabel ;
                    owl:minCardinality "1" ] .
@
```

**Example.** In the next example we introduce the concept of *Heser stoevi*
according to the article published by Deltshev in 2016. First, we introduce an
instance of `:TaxonConcept` and link this instance to the scientific name
*Heser stoevi* via the appropriate DwC term. Next, we establish a link between
the significant bibliographic unit (in this case journal article) containing
the treatment, which is the realization of the taxon concept. The last point
we would like to make is that the taxon concept label, which is in this case
`Heser stoevi sec. 10.3897/BDJ.4.e100095` is constructed by pasting together
the label of the biological name and the expression that are assigned to the
concept glued together by `sec.`.

```
<<Examples>>=

   skos:prefLabel "Heser stoevi Deltshev sec. 10.3897/BDJ.4.e10095" ;

                pkm:mentions :heser-stoevi-sec-gbif20170323  ] .
@
```

Note that in the above example one scientific name, *Heser stoevi*, is linked
to two different taxon concept labels, as one taxon concept label denotes the
concept coming from the article and the other one comes from the GBIF
database.

It is possible to express that these are the same thing, that one is a
subconcept of the other, or even more granular relationships.

#### Taxon Concept Relationships

**Example congruence 1.** If we want to express that two concepts
are exactly the same both intensionally and ostensively, then we use `owl:sameAs`.
However, if we want to express that the taxon concepts have the same extension
without being equal intensionally (as in the spider example), then we use
`owl:equivalentClass`.

```
<<Examples>>=

:heser-stoevi-sec-deltschev owl:sameAs :heser-stoevi-sec-gbif20170323 .
@
```

Note that this will copy both taxon concept labels both ways, but this is OK
as the different taxon concept labels refer to the same class.

**Example congruence 2.** Let's define the two spider concepts here.

```
<<Examples>>=

:haveSpinnerets rdf:type owl:DatatypeProperty ;
  rdfs:domain :TaxonConcept ; 
  rdfs:comment "This property if true, indicates that some taxon has spinnertes." .

:havePedipals rdf:type owl:DataTypeProperty ;
  rdfs:domain :TaxonConcept ;
  rdfs:comment "If this property is true, that the taxon has pedipals" .

:spiders-with-spinnerets-sec-rdfguide a :TaxonConceptLabel ;
  dwc:order "Araneae" ;
  skos:prefLabel "Araneae sec. OpenBiodiv RDF Guide" ;
  :nameAccordingTo <https://github.com/pensoft/OpenBiodiv/blob/master/Ontology/RDF_Guide.md> .

:spiders-with-pedipals-sec-rdfguide a :TaxonConceptLabel ;
  dwc:order "Aranea" ;
  skos:prefLabel "Araneae sec. OpenBiodiv RDF Guide" ;
  :nameAccordingTo <https://github.com/pensoft/OpenBiodiv/blob/master/Ontology/RDF_Guide.md> .

:concept-spinnerets a :TaxonConcept ;
  :taxonConceptLabel :spiders-with-spinnerets-sec-rdfguide ;
  :haveSpinnerrets "true"^^xsd:boolean .

:concept-pedipals a :TaxonConcept ;
  :taxonConceptLabel :spiders-with-pedipals-sec-rdfguide ;
  :havePedipals "true"^^xsd:boolean .

:spider1 a :concept-spinnerts .
:spider2 a :concept-pedipals .

:concept-spinnerts owl:equivalentClass :concept-pedipals .
@
```

Here, the implication is that although the intensional meaning of the two concepts
is different, they have the same class extension. I.e. we will infer

```
:spider1 a :concept-pedipals;
:spider2 a :concept-spinnerts'
```

but we will not copy any of the `:havePedipals` or `:haveSpinnerts` to the other concept.

**Example of contained concepts.** For contained concept we use `rdfs:subClassOf`:

```
<<Examples>>=

:animalia-sec-gbif a :TaxonConceptLabel ;
  skos:prefLabel "Animalia sec. GBIF Backbone Taxonomy" ;
  dwciri:scientificName :animalia ;
  :nameAccordingTo <http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.15468/39omei> .

:animalia a :ScientificName ;
  dwc:scientificName "Animalia" ;
  dwc:taxonRank "kingdom" ;
  dc:date "2017-03-23"^^xsd:date ;
  dwciri:taxonomicStatus :Available .

:concept-animalia-gbif a :TaxonConcept ;
  dwciri:scientificName :animalia ;
  dwc:taxonId "1 (GBIF)" .

:heser-stoevi-sec-gbif20170323 rdfs:subClassOf :animlia-sec-gbif20170323 .
@
```

**Example (Relatedness)** If two taxon concepts are related we can use `skos:related`.

```
<<Examples>>=

:heser-nicola a :ScientificName ;
  dwc:scientificName "Heser nilicola (O. P.-Cambridge, 1874)" ;
  skos:prefLabel "Heser nilicola" ;

  dwc:species "nilicola" ;
  dwc:taxonRank "species" .

#### Complex Relationships with RCC-5

In order to model complex RCC-5 statements such as those made in
[Jansen & Franz 2015](https://doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.528.6001) we use 
the above defitions and the RCC5 Vocabulary described in the Appendix.

We model the following exceprt here:

"Minyomerus microps (Say, 1831: 9) sec. Jansen & Franz (2015), stat. n.  ==
(INT) AND > (OST) AND = Minyomerus innocuus Horn, 1876: 18 sec. Horn (1876) (type, designated by Pierce 1913: 400), syn. n."

#### The rest of Biodiversity Sysmtematics

We follow the Darwin-SW model.

## Apendicies

### Vocabulary of Taxonomic Statuses

[Taxonomic name usages](#taxonomic-name-usage) (TNU's) in taxonomic articles
may be accompanied by strings such as "new. comb.", "new syn.", "new record
for Cuba", and many others. These postfixes to a taxonomic name usage are
called in our model taxonomic statuses and have taxonomic as well
nomenclatural meaning. For example, if we are describing a species new to
science, we may write "n. sp." after the species name, e.g. "*Heser stoevi*
Deltchev sp. n." This particular example is also a nomenclatural act in the
sense of the Codes of zoological or botanical nomenclature.

Not all statuses are necessarily nomenclatural in nature. Sometimes the status
is more of a note to the reader and conveys taxonomic rather than
nomenclatural information. E.g. when a previously known species is recorded in
a new location.

Here we take the road of modeling statuses from the bottom-up, i.e. based on
their actual use in three of the most successful journals in biological
systematics - ZooKeys, Biodiversity Data Journal, and PhytoKeys. We have
analyzed about 4,000 articles from these journals and have come up with a
vocabulary of statuses described below. The terms in this vocabulary refer to
broad concepts and encompass both specific cases of botanical or zoological
nomenclature as well as purely taxonomic or informative use. We believe these
concepts to be adequately granular for the purposes of reasoning in OpenBiodiv
(see the paragraphs on rules in [biological names](#biological-names).

## Extraction of 4,000 TNU suffixes

1. The first step we took in creating this vocabulary is to extract the actual
real-world taxonomic statuses as found almost 4,000 Pensoft articles. The
script to achieve this is found under [mine_tnu.R](R/mine_tnu.R). The output of
the script is a list of taxonomic status abbreviations as a text file,
[taxonomic_statuses.txt](status_abbrev/all.txt), in total 253 distinct
usages.

2. The second step we took is to normalize these statuses manually: clean up
parts of abbreviations that are not part of the status (such as particular
taxon names) or remove irrelevant statuses (such as geological information).

3. After cleaning up the usages we came up with the terms in the next section
and assigned each of remaining status abbreviations to one of the terms. The
assignments can be seen in text files with correspondning names.

For a similar attempt, see
<http://rs.gbif.org/vocabulary/gbif/taxonomic_status.xml>. We do map our
statuses to the GBIF statuses to the best of our knowledge but we have more
statuses.

### Taxonomic Uncertainty

When a TNU is followed by the term `:TaxonomicUncertainty`, the implication is
that the taxon concept identified by the name has an uncertain placement in
the biological taxonomy, or if we are talking about a specimen or a sample of
some kind that we are unable to identify the taxon down to its rank. This
is related to <http://rs.gbif.org/vocabulary/gbif/taxonomicStatus/accepted>

```
<<Taxonomic Uncertainty>>=

:TaxonomicUncertainty a :TaxonomicStatus ;
  rdfs:label "Taxonomic Uncertainty"@en ;
  skos:inScheme :TaxonomicStatusTerms ;
  skos:related <http://rs.gbif.org/vocabulary/gbif/taxonomicStatus/accepted> ;
 
  rdfs:comment "The implication of this term that the taxon concept identified
by a name has an uncertain placement in the biological taxonomy, or if we
are talking about a specimen or a sample of some kind that we are unable to
identify the taxon down to its rank. "@en .

@
```

Here're some ways in which it can be abbreivated:

[taxonomic_uncertainty.txt](status_abbrev/taxonomic_uncertainty.txt)

#### Taxon Discovery

When a TNU is followed by the term `:TaxonDiscovery`, the implication is that
the present context in which the TNU is used is circumscribing a new taxon
concept (a taxon concept of a taxon new to science), and simultaneously
assigning it a new name.

```
<<Taxon Discovery>>=

:TaxonDiscovery a :TaxonomicStatus ;
  skos:inScheme :TaxonomicStatusTerms ;
  rdfs:label "Taxon Discovery"@en ;

  rdfs:comment "When a TNU is followed by the term `:TaxonDiscovery`, the
implication is that the present context in which the TNU is used is
circumscribing a new taxon concept (a taxon concept of a taxon new to
science), and simultaneously assigning it a new name."@en .

@
```

Here're some ways in which it can be abbreivated:

[taxon_discovery.txt](R/taxon_discovery.txt)

#### Replacement Name

When a TNU is followed by the term `:ReplacementName`, the implication is that
the name that is referred to by the TNU is replacing another name for various
reasons, and thus becoming the preferred/accepted/available way of refering to
whatever taxon concepts the now replaced name had been referring to. Cases
include changes of rank, new combinations, spelling mistakes, etc.

```
<<Replacement Name>>=

:ReplacementName a :TaxonomicStatus ;
  skos:inScheme :TaxonomicStatusTerms ;
  rdfs:label "Replacement Name"@en ;
  rdfs:comment "When a TNU is followed by the term `:ReplacementName`, the implication is that

@
```
Here're some ways in which it can be abbreivated:

[replacement_name.txt](R/replacement_name.txt)

#### Unavailable Name

When a TNU is followed by the term `:UnavailableName`, the implication is that
the name that is being referred to by the TNU is no longer or has never been
available for use due to the fact that it has either been replaced or it has
been determined that the name has been improperly coined or published, or the
name contains any general error rendering it unfit for use. This is the
same as <http://rs.gbif.org/vocabulary/gbif/taxonomicStatus/synonym>

```
<<Unavailable Name>>=

:UnavailabeName a :TaxonomicStatus ;
  skos:inScheme :TaxonomicStatusTerms ;
  rdfs:label "UnavailableName"@en ;

```

Here're some ways in which it can be abbreivated:

[unavaible_name.txt](R/unavavaible_name.txt)

#### Available Name

When a TNU is followed by the term `:AvailableName`, the implication is that
the name that is being referred to by the TNU has been determined to be fit
for use either by revoking an older act rendering the name unavailable or by
fixing other issues with the name or finding out that other issues with the
name had been fixed, or just stating the fact that the name shall be used or
even conserving it, so that the name can be freely used from then on in
compliance with all Codes and practices. This is the same as
<http://rs.gbif.org/vocabulary/gbif/taxonomicStatus/accepted>

```
<<Available Name>>=

:AvailableName a :TaxonomicStatus ;
  skos:inScheme :TaxonomicStatusTerms ;
  rdfs:Label "Available Name"@en ;

from then on in compliance with all Codes and practices."@en.
@
```

[available_name.txt](R/available_name.txt)

#### Type Species Designation

When a TNU is followed by the term `:TypeSpeciesDesignation`, the implication
is that the taxon concept of the name in the TNU as understood by the author
should be considered the type species of a higher taxon as understood by the
author.

```
<<Type Species Designation>>=

:TypeSpeciesDesignation a :TaxonomicStatus ;
  rdfs:label "Type Species Designation" @en ;
  skos:inScheme :TaxonomicStatusTerms ;

should be considered the type species of a higher taxon as understood by the
author."@en.

@
```

[type_species_designation.txt](R/type_species_designation.txt)

#### Type Specimen Designation

When a TNU is followed by the term `:TypeSpecimenDesignation`, the implication
is that the specimen identified by the name in TNU should be considered a type
of the taxon concept identified by the name as understood by the author of
TNU.

```
<<Type Specimen Designation>>=

:TypeSpecimenDesignation a :TaxonomicStatus ;
  rdfs:label "Type Specimen Designation" @en ;
  skos:inScheme :TaxonomicStatusTerms ;
  rdfs:comment "When a TNU is followed by the term `:TypeSpecimenDesignation`, the implication

TNU."@en.

@

```

[type_specimen_designation.txt](R/type_specimen_designation.txt)

#### New Record

When a TNU is followed by the term `:NewRecord`, the implication is that the
description of taxon concept of the name as understood by the author is being
extended with new occurrences (for a given locality).


```
<<New Occurrence Record>>=

:NewOccurrenceRecord a :TaxonomicStatus ;
  rdfs:label "New Occurrence Record" @en ;
  skos:inScheme :TaxonomicStatusTerms ;

"@en.

@
```

[new_occurrence_record.txt](R/new_occurrence_record.txt)

#### Taxon Concept Label

Sometimes, incorrectly a taxon concept label (sec. Author (year) may be
misunderstood and marked up) as a taxonomic status. This term has been created
to indicate that a particular TNU is taxonomic concept label.

```
<<Taxon Concept Label>>=

:TaxonConceptLabel a :TaxonomicStatus ;
  skos:inScheme :TaxonomicStatusTerms ;
  rdfs:label "Taxon Concept Label"@en ;

### Vocabulary of Paper Types

TODO: Future work

**Def.:** Pensoft's journals have some
paper types, which we define herein. First of all, we introduce Paper Types as
a Term Dictionary in the discipline of Bibliography. Then we introduce the
different paper types as Subject Term's in the scheme of Paper Types. See the
SPAR ontologies for more info on this this.
