In our understanding of the domain every taxon concepts needs to have at least
one expression.

TODO Is this possible to express this OWL? It would be simpler to express it
in SPARQL.

##### 2. Taxon concepts may be linked to a scientific name

Linnaean names are an attempt to label taxa. In most cases taxon concepts will
be linked to exactly one scientific name

For all practical purposes the semantics of
<http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Taxon> are compatible with the notion of a taxon
concepts. Our understanding of taxon concepts is based on [Franz et al.
(2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4911943/).
In order to be able to instantiate taxon concepts, we import "Darwin Semantic
Web, version 1.0", where `dwc:Taxon` is defined. 


**Remark and example 13.** Note that 

Taxon concepts are related to one another via simple relationships and
via RCC-5 properties.

#### Simple Taxon Concept Relationships

- is_a (this can be used when you refine a concept, or when 
a higher rank subsumes a lower rank)
- relatedTo (when you have two overlaping but different concepts)
- congruent (when two concepts are exactly the same)

#### RCC-5 Relationships

Complex RCC 5 relationships will be modeled as separate entities.

#### Scientific Name

### of the Ecological Domain

### of General Ideas

#### "preferred label"

The individual entities in OpenBiodiv all have unique identifiers. In addition
to those identifiers, the objects have labels that are there primarily for
human consumption. Labels can be things like the DOI (in the case of an
article), the Latin name of a taxon. This preferred label is encoded with the
property `skos:prefLabel`. Furthermore, an object can have secondary
(alternative) labels such as a different spelling of a scientific name, or a
vernacular name of a taxon. In this case we use `skos:altLabel`.


#### Biological names

In OpenBiodiv/OBKMS, we reify scientific names.
[NOMEN](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/nomen) does provide classes for
scientific names. For example, the identifier for class "biological name" is
`NOMEN_0000030`. However, the identifiers that NOMEN uses are meaningless. This
is justified in some cases (TODO citation needed), however, in our workflow both
RDF generation and debugging would be severely hampered by this convention.
That's why we have defined names in OpenBiodiv and mapped them to their NOMEN
equivalents.
