# Open Biodiversity Knowledge Management System

Hi! Welcome to the Open Biodiversity Knowledge Management System: a PhD
project project by [Viktor Senderov](#viktor-senderov).

The system is called *OpenBiodiv* or *OBKMS*. OBKMS is the older name, but we
prefer to call it OpenBiodiv recently.

This reposititory contains the architecture, documentation, deployment
scripts, papers, and otherwise all material that will go into my dissertation.
In addition to that there is R package,
[ropenbio](https://github.com/pensoft/ropenbio) that contains the source code
doing the heavy lifting.

The system itself is deployed at [openbiodiv.net](http://openbiodiv.net/).

## Papers

- [OpenBiodiv PhD Proposal](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.2.e7757)
- [An early paper on occurrence records](https://riojournal.com/article/10617/)
- [Taxonomic paper with scripts illustrating convestion of DwC data to the BOLD format](https://zookeys.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=12522)

If you want to email me, you are more than welcome to, but you have to pass
the following reverse turing test. There is a new sexy name for statistics
today. You could think of it as the science of data. My email is this name
(one word) and the domain is the domain of [Pensoft](http://pensoft.net/)
