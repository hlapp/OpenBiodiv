# OpenBiodiv PhD Project

Hi! Welcome to the OpenBiodiv PhD project by [Viktor Senderov](https://github.com/vsenderov/) at [Pensoft](http://pensoft.net) as part of the Marie-Curie training network for genomics, bioinformatics, and systematics of the [BIG 4](http://big4-project.eu) insect groups.

OpenBiodiv is a knowledge management system of biodiversity data. Its components are 

- the ontology [OpenBiodiv-O](https://github.com/vsenderov/openbiodiv-o)
- a [semantic graph database/ linked open dataset](http://graph.openbiodiv.net) populated with informationfrom three sources:

  - [Pensoft's journals](https://pensoft.net/browse_journals)
  - [Plazi's Treatment Bank](http://plazi.org/resources/treatmentbank/)
  - [GBIF Taxonomic Backbone](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/d7dddbf4-2cf0-4f39-9b2a-bb099caae36c)

More information can be found in this draft text of a chapter of my PhD.

The system is called *OpenBiodiv* or *OBKMS*. OBKMS is the older name, but we
prefer to call it OpenBiodiv recently.

This reposititory contains the architecture, documentation, deployment
scripts, papers, and otherwise all material that will go into my dissertation.
In addition to that there is R package,
[ropenbio](https://github.com/pensoft/ropenbio) that contains the source code
doing the heavy lifting.

The system itself is deployed at [openbiodiv.net](http://openbiodiv.net/).

If you want to email me, you are more than welcome to, but you have to pass
the following reverse turing test. There is a new sexy name for statistics
today. You could think of it as the science of data. My email is this name
(one word) and the domain is the domain of [Pensoft](http://pensoft.net/)
