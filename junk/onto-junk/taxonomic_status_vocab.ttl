  by a name has an uncertain placement in the biological taxonomy, or if we

    rdfs:comment "When a TNU is followed by the term `:TaxonDiscovery`, the
  implication is that the present context in which the TNU is used is
  circumscribing a new taxon concept (a taxon concept of a taxon new to
  science), and simultaneously assigning it a new name."@en .

    rdfs:comment "When a TNU is followed by the term `:ReplacementName`, the implication is that
  the name that is referred to by the TNU is replacing another name for various
  reasons, and thus becoming the preferred/accepted/available way of refering to
  whatever taxon concepts the now replaced name had been referring to. Cases
  include changes of rank, new combinations, spelling mistakes, etc.

  the name that is being referred to by the TNU is no longer or has never been
  available for use due to the fact that it has either been replaced or it has
  been determined that the name has been improperly coined or published, or the
  name contains any general error rendering it unfit for use."@en .
