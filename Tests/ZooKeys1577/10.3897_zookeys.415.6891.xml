            <p>The <tp:taxon-name>Stenochiinae</tp:taxon-name> (<tp:taxon-name>Coleoptera</tp:taxon-name>: <tp:taxon-name>Tenebrionidae</tp:taxon-name>) are a large, diverse group of darkling beetles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Matthews et al. 2010</xref>), but even in areas with faunas considered to be well known, immature stages of many common species remain undescribed, especially the ephemeral pupae. Stenochiine larvae often possess distinctive apical abdominal armature, presumed to be defensive. Known pupal structures inspire equal curiosity and provide good characters for analysis of generic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bouchard and Steiner 2004</xref>). Larvae and pupae of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Glyptotus cribratus</tp:taxon-name></italic> LeConte from the southeastern United States and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cibdelis blaschkei</tp:taxon-name></italic> Mannerheim from California – the type-species of their respective genera – are described in this study for the first time, with the intent of contributing to characterization of features useful for future identification and studies of phylogeny. Both species inhabit forested regions where adults, larvae and pupae have been found in soft rotten dry wood of dead branches on living trees or in sections recently fallen from them. The discovery and recognition of this particular niche should facilitate collection of these and other tenebrionid larvae occupying forest habitats.</p>

            <p>Larval specimens were preserved in 80% ethanol; prior to this, some were killed either with hot water or by fumigation in ethyl acetate. Pupal specimens were similarly preserved as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Steiner 1995</xref>). Specimen label data below are given verbatim, with commas inserted for clarity, and breaks between labels are separated by a forward slash. Numbers of specimens bearing those data follow in parentheses, indicated as <abbrev>(L)<def><p> larva</p></def></abbrev>, <abbrev>(P)<def><p> pupa</p></def></abbrev>, or adult with associated exuvia.

                    <p>A single larva from southern Florida, USA, presumed to be <italic><tp:taxon-name>Glyptotus cribratus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, was reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">St. George (1924)</xref>, who provided some key characters though the specimen’s identity has remained uncertain. New associated adult and larval material, including one larva reared to an adult and another providing the first known pupal specimen (described herein), shows that the larva from St. George’s account was not that of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Glyptotus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, as discussed below. The specimen, presumably in USNM, could not be located.</p>
                    <p>Three mature larvae, found in wood products from Mexico, 1982–84, were identified as “<!--PageBreak--><italic><tp:taxon-name>Glyptotus</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp.” by T. J. Spilman, but it is uncertain what material he used to make this determination; these larvae are considered in the present study to be <italic><tp:taxon-name>Glyptotus cribratus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, identical to specimens from USA; the species is known from southern Texas and thus its occurrence in north-eastern Mexico is feasible.</p>

                    <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Cibdelis blaschkei</tp:taxon-name></italic> is a very common beetle throughout much of California, with large series of adults represented in collections, but surprisingly, no specimens of its larvae or pupae could be found in museum holdings, nor are there any records of immature stages in the literature. The discovery of aerial dead wood larval habitats on trees in eastern USA localities led to the examination of similar wood in California, resulting in the collections listed below. Several other <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cibdelis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species have been described, all from California; the genus needs revision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Aalbu et al. 2002</xref>).</p>

                    <title>Habitats and observations on life history.</title>
                    <p>Both <italic><tp:taxon-name>Glyptotus cribratus</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cibdelis blaschkei</tp:taxon-name></italic> are beetles of forested areas, their larvae being dependent on dead, rotten wood for survival. They tend to be more common in forest edge habitats or at single trees or groves in open areas, where wood dries out more rapidly and is slower to decay than in mesic forest interiors. These species may be avoiding attack by fungal, bacterial, or other pathogens and/or avoiding competition from insects inhabiting more damp wood in shaded situations. Furthermore, larvae are rarely if ever found in rotten wood on the ground, with the exception of recently fallen branches; these beetles appear to be specialists in dead wood involving mostly smaller branches, on living, usually old trees. Specimen data and observations indicate that if inhabited branches happen to fall, older, nearly full-grown larvae may be able to complete development. Adults probably breed commonly in canopy-level wood; an opportunity to observe <italic><tp:taxon-name>Glyptotus cribratus</tp:taxon-name></italic> on dead canopy branches of oak (Little Cumberland Island, Georgia) led to collection of adults and larvae in exposed, rotten branches several meters above ground. The dead oak branches in which <italic><tp:taxon-name>Glyptotus</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cibdelis</tp:taxon-name></italic> have been found were usually covered with lichens, which possibly serve as food for adults.</p>
                    <p>Adult beetles are nocturnal, often found on bark at night, but hide during the day in hollow dead branches as well as under the bark of dead branches or main trunks. Adults and larvae of both species are active throughout the year, but pupation seems to be restricted to spring and summer. Larvae tunnel in moderately soft dry wood, consuming it (and probably fungal tissue within) and depositing pelleted frass in the <!--PageBreak-->burrow; they can occur immediately under the bark or in the branch interior. Most larvae have been collected in smaller branches, 3–15 cm diameter, with wood that is easily broken apart by hand. Pupation occurs in the same wood. In one instance, the pupal period lasted 19 days for a Texas specimen of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Glyptotus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, reared at 22–26°C; no comparable pupal data are available for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cibdelis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, but the period is likely similar. Except for one record of a pupa beneath bark of an undetermined pine species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cibdelis blaschkei</tp:taxon-name></italic> is typically associated with oaks.</p>
                    <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Glyptotus cribratus</tp:taxon-name></italic> occurs from coastal Virginia to Texas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Hoffman et al. 2002</xref>) where it is often associated with live oak, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Quercus virginiana</tp:taxon-name></italic> Mill., which has a similar distribution, but other species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Quercus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, as well as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Celtis</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Prosopis</tp:taxon-name></italic> spp., are recorded hosts. Beetles are most common in maritime oak forests and sandhill habitats of the coastal plain but also occur in middle elevations of the southern Appalachians. This species is common as well in the elevated karst areas of central Texas (Edwards Plateau), which have a distinct oak flora.</p>

                    <title>Observations on defense structures and behaviour.</title>
                    <p><bold>Larval characters.</bold> In larvae of both <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cibdelis</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Glyptotus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, the manner in which the long, upcurved urogomphi oppose the raised areas and posterior projections of tergite 8 appear to form a pinching structure, as seen in occasional specimens preserved in the “closed” position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">16</xref>). The opportunity to observe pinching behavior was offered by the recent collections of larvae on several occasions. When larvae are removed from the burrow in dead wood, they appear incapable of rapid evasive movement but do writhe in a circular movement when held at the middle by forceps or fingers, and the hinged urogomphi can be seen to open and close against segment 8 when the end of the abdomen is touched. Inserting a stiff hair, fine piece of grass, or insect pin tip in the dorsal gap between tergites 8 and 9 usually prompted the larva to pinch; occasionally, the larva will hold on and can be lifted off the substrate for several seconds before releasing the pinch. When full-grown larvae of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Glyptotus</tp:taxon-name></italic> were first exposed and restrained, pinches were observed and felt on fingertips; the larvae also appeared to be trying to bite with mandibles. These actions could possibly defend the larvae from attack by small lizards and other predators. When approached in the wood tunnel by a potential predatory insect, either end could be capable of some defense.</p>
                    <p>Pointed, upturned urogomphi are present in many tenebrionid larvae, but few posess opposing processes on tergite 8 and the hinge-like joint between segments. Long tactile setae, “trigger hairs,” are associated with processes on tergite 8 and occupy the space between the sloped dorsum of tergite 8 and the urogomphi at rest. The paired processes seen in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cibdelis</tp:taxon-name></italic> larvae are of unique form, previously unknown, but the hinge-like joint is not apparent. The raised bullae of tergite 8 and other features of the pinching assembly in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Glyptotus</tp:taxon-name></italic> are very similar to those of the related stenochiine larva, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Haplandrus fulvipes</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Herbst) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">St. George 1924</xref>, Figs 38–39). In the same work, a larva identified as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Glyptotus</tp:taxon-name></italic> from Florida was described in the key with “Pygidium with transverse row of strong, hook-shaped, seta-bearing spines anterior to cerci” but was not illustrated. This larva could not have been <italic><tp:taxon-name>Glyptotus</tp:taxon-name></italic> because these different features are all on tergum 9; no modifications of tergum 8 were noted.</p>
                    <!--PageBreak-->
                    <p>Larvae of <tp:taxon-name>Helopini</tp:taxon-name>, also described from dead wood, have abdominal apices very similar to those of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Glyptotus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, for example <italic><tp:taxon-name>Helops caeruleus</tp:taxon-name></italic> L. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Schiödte 1878</xref>, Figs 20–21, Plate 11) and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Deretus spinicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Schawaller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Purchart and Nabozhenko 2012</xref>, Figs 9–10). The pinching ability of these larvae is probably comparable to that of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Glyptotus</tp:taxon-name></italic>.</p>
                    <p><bold>Pupal characters.</bold> Like known pupae of other stenochiines, those of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cibdelis</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Glyptotus</tp:taxon-name></italic> are armed with lateral abdominal gin traps that pinch between the posterior and anterior curved teeth, with lateral projecting spines and associated tactile hairs. Use of these structures and associated body movements have been studied in other pupae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bouchard and Steiner 2004</xref> and papers cited within) and the live pupae observed in this study displayed these actions. Pupal cells in the soft wood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 28</xref>), formed by the mature larva before pupation, offer a large space in which pupae can actively rotate the body and use pinching organs. As noted in other stenochiine pupae, gin trap teeth of opposing lateral processes have the “posterior is ventral to anterior” closure type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Steiner 1995</xref>, Fig. 104) in the pinched position.</p>
                    <p>Pupae of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Glyptotus cribratus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, a winged species, possess fully formed wing sheaths beneath the elytral sheaths. Conversely, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cibdelis blaschkei</tp:taxon-name></italic> is wingless, with elytra partially fused, though pupae still retain empty wing sheaths of nearly full length—a condition noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Spilman (1979)</xref> in which a long sheath with vestigial or absent wing development indicates occasional flightlessness within groups otherwise characterized by flight. This is the case among <tp:taxon-name>Stenochiinae</tp:taxon-name>, where flightlessness appears to have evolved multiple times within a large clade of mostly winged species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Matthews et al. 2010</xref>).</p>
