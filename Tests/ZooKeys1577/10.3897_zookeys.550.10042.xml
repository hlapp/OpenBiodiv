    <sec sec-type="1. Introduction">
      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Article 79 of the Fourth Edition of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (henceforth Code) describes an official List of Available Names in Zoology (henceforth <abbrev xlink:title="List of Available Names">LAN</abbrev>), consisting of a series of “Parts” (of defined taxonomic and temporal scope), compiled by relevant experts. The <abbrev xlink:title="List of Available Names">LAN</abbrev> represents a comprehensive inventory of names available under the Code. The aim of this manual is to define a procedure for implementing Article 79, with format suggestions for zoologists aiming to create a Part of the <abbrev xlink:title="List of Available Names">LAN</abbrev> for family-group, genus-group, or species-group names in zoological nomenclature. Because the <abbrev xlink:title="List of Available Names">LAN</abbrev> may serve as an important basis for retrospective content in ZooBank, the structure outlined here is designed to allow easy importation to ZooBank.</p>
      <p>A Part ultimately adopted for the <abbrev xlink:title="List of Available Names">LAN</abbrev> will contain nomenclaturally available names but not necessarily all those within the scope of the Part: the comprehensiveness of the candidate Part is at the discretion of the experts proposing the Part. They may choose to in<!--PageBreak-->clude all nomenclaturally available names or use the proposal of a Part to pare away <italic>nomina dubia</italic> so they lose “status in zoological nomenclature despite any previous availability” (to quote Articles 10.7 and 79.4.3; that this was the intention of the framers of Article 79 is clear from the Preface to the Code). Nonetheless, we advocate that the proposing body include an inventory of all known names deemed to be available so it will be obvious that names not advocated for inclusion in the Part have not simply been overlooked. Because a candidate Part of the <abbrev xlink:title="List of Available Names">LAN</abbrev> is for an entire taxon at the specified rank and for the specified period, it must include the names of both living and fossil representatives of the taxon.</p>
      <p>In the proposal for adding a Part to the <abbrev xlink:title="List of Available Names">LAN</abbrev>, an unavailable name corresponding to a later available one should be included in the Remarks section of the available name. Unavailable names that have not subsequently been made available can be added at the end of the candidate Part, along with information explaining them. The Commission and reviewers of the candidate Part will thereby have a list of such names and an understanding of why they are not available. Moreover, these names can be discussed during the periods required by Article 79 for input by the zoological community, when change in their status can be advocated by members of the community interested in the taxon under consideration.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="2. Code authority">
      <title>2. Code authority</title>
      <p>The consideration of candidate Parts of the <abbrev xlink:title="List of Available Names">LAN</abbrev> is specified by some articles of the Code as well as the Bylaws and Constitution of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (henceforth the Commission). Parallel with this are provisions for the treatment of the Official Lists and Indexes. The relevant portions are reproduced below.</p>
      <sec sec-type="2.1. List of Available Names, Official Lists and Indexes">
        <title>2.1. List of Available Names, Official Lists and Indexes</title>
        <p>
          <bold>2.1.1. In the Preface of the Code</bold>
        </p>
        <p>“We can anticipate that zoologists and other users of scientific names will before long require still further changes in the Code, perhaps especially concerning procedures for the listing of existing names and the registration of new ones. With regard to the former, extensive databases are now appearing in quick succession and are being consolidated by such enterprises as Species 2000, and this fourth edition of the Code has already taken a significant step through the provisions for the development and adoption of List(s) of Available Names in Zoology.”</p>
        <p>“Progress is made in this edition to establish a mechanism to facilitate access to previously established names, and to achieve certainty that searches made for names are complete, by enabling international groups of specialists to compile lists of extant and known available names in major taxonomic fields, and to have these lists adopted by <!--PageBreak-->the Commission. Names not in a relevant adopted List would not be available. A similar policy has already been adopted for all genera and species in microbiology, where neither past nor new names are available unless they have been officially recorded.”</p>
        <p>“Lists of Available Names</p>
        <p>
          <styled-content style="padding-left:40px; text-indent:-20px; display:block;">15. The Commission is empowered, with safeguards, to adopt lists of names in major taxonomic fields. Names within the scope of such an adopted list but not listed in it will be treated as unavailable. Lists may only be adopted by the Commission which have been proposed by international bodies, and only after publication of the proposals, wide consultation with specialist committees and others, and taking into account public comment.”</styled-content>

Identical species-group names established for different nominal taxa when originally combined with the same generic name (see also Articles 11.9.3.2 and 57.8.1) are primary homonyms [Art. 53.3] and the junior name is permanently invalid (but see Article 23.9.5) except when:</styled-content>

        <p>
          <styled-content style="padding-left:60px; text-indent:-20px; display:block;">79.5.1. From the date of the publication in the Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature of the amended entry the relevant name has the status, spelling, date of availability, and authorship, and the nominal taxon it denotes has the name-bearing type, as shown in the amended entry.</styled-content>
        </p>
        <p>
          <styled-content style="padding-left:60px; text-indent:-20px; display:block;">79.5.2. The requirement that amendments to the status of names occurring in the List may be made only by the Commission using its plenary power does not prevent an author from designating a type species for a nominal genus-group taxon published before 1931, if one has not already been fixed, or from designating a lectotype [Art. 74] from syntypes recorded in the List of Available Names in Zoology, or a neotype when circumstances exist that require neotype designation [Art. 75]. Such subsequent fixations may be inserted by the Commission in the List.</styled-content>
        </p>
        <p>
          <italic>Recommendation</italic> 79B. Request to authors designating lectotypes or neotypes for names in the List of Available Names in Zoology. Authors are requested to inform the Commission of lectotype or neotype designations made by them for the nominal taxa of names in the List of Available Names in Zoology as soon as possible after publication.</p>
        <p>
          <styled-content style="padding-left:40px; text-indent:-20px; display:block;">79.6. Power of the Commission to add omitted names to the List of Available Names in Zoology. If the Commission determines that there is a previously available name within the scope of an adopted Part of the List of Available Names in Zoology that has been omitted from the List, in exceptional circumstances the Commission may by use of the plenary power add an appropriate entry to that Part of the List and record this in an Opinion. The availability of the name thereby becomes restored.</styled-content>
        </p>
        <p>Article 80. Status of actions of the Commission. As a consequence of actions required of it by the Code, the Commission may publish Declarations, Opinions, the Official Lists and Official Indexes, and may adopt and publish Parts of the List of Available Names in Zoology. The status of these published acts, and of names and works in the Official Lists and Official Indexes, is specified in this Article.</p>
        <p>
          <styled-content style="padding-left:40px; text-indent:-20px; display:block;">80.4. Corrections of errors or omissions in Opinions. Official Corrections to errors and omissions (such as a bibliographic error, lapsus calami, or an omission in placing a conserved or suppressed name on an Official List or Index) may be published by the Commission without further vote unless the error or omission negates the ruling or its consequences. If the ruling is negated by the error or omission, the Commission shall reconsider the matter and publish a further Opinion.</styled-content>

        <p>
          <styled-content style="padding-left:60px; text-indent:-20px; display:block;">80.6.1. A name entered in an Official List is an available name.</styled-content>

        <p>
          <styled-content style="padding-left:60px; text-indent:-20px; display:block;">80.6.2. The status of a name entered in an Official List is subject to the ruling(s) in any relevant Opinion(s), including any Official Correction of an Opinion [Art. 80.4]; all other aspects of its status derive from the normal application of the Code. However, if such a name is given a different status in the List of Available Names in Zoology the latter status is deemed to be correct [Art. 80.8].</styled-content>
        </p>
        <p>
          <styled-content style="padding-left:60px; text-indent:-20px; display:block;">80.6.3. A name may be placed in an Official List without any additional qualification.</styled-content>

          <styled-content style="padding-left:60px; text-indent:-20px; display:block;">80.6.4. If a name entered in an Official List is thought to be a synonym of another available name (whether in an Official List or not), their relative precedence is determined by the normal application of the Code unless the Commission rules or has ruled otherwise.</styled-content>

        <p>
          <styled-content style="padding-left:60px; text-indent:-20px; display:block;">80.6.5. A name or nomenclatural act occurring in a work entered in the Official List of Works Approved as Available for Zoological Nomenclature is subject to the provisions of the Code and to any limitation imposed by the Commission on the use of that work in zoological nomenclature.</styled-content>

        <p>
          <styled-content style="padding-left:60px; text-indent:-20px; display:block;">80.7.1. A work, name or nomenclatural act entered in an Official Index has the status attributed to it in the relevant ruling(s).</styled-content>

        <p>
          <styled-content style="padding-left:60px; text-indent:-20px; display:block;">80.7.2. A name or nomenclatural act occurring in a work entered in the Official Index has no availability or validity in zoological nomenclature, unless the Commission by use of its plenary power rules otherwise. However, such a work may be used as a source of information relevant to zoological nomenclature unless the Commission has ruled that the work is to be treated as unpublished.</styled-content>

Contradictory status accorded by the Commission to names in the List of Available Names in Zoology and in the Official Lists. In the event of contradictory status being accorded by the Commission to a name included in the List of Available Names in Zoology, in an Official List, or in an Opinion, the status accorded in the List of Available Names in Zoology is deemed to be correct unless the Commission has ruled otherwise [Art. 79.5].</styled-content>

      <p>Although it is clear from several Articles of the Code that the <abbrev xlink:title="List of Available Names">LAN</abbrev> and the Official Lists and Indexes are different entities, neither it nor the Bylaws and Constitution are very explicit about the differences and the relationship between them.

Three others are related to Names and Nomenclatural Acts (one each for Species, Genera, and Families) whose status is ruled by Article 80.6.

        <title>4.3. Family-group names</title>
        <p>For the purpose of compiling a Part of the <abbrev xlink:title="List of Available Names">LAN</abbrev>, a family-group name is any uninominal, plural noun or nominalized adjective (Arts. 4.1, 11.7.1, 29). It may be formed by adding to the stem of a valid type genus name any suffix and/or ending (Arts. 11.7, 29, 63, 64), even if not standard under the Code (Arts. 11.7, 29); originally it can be attributed to any rank included in the family- group in the system followed by its author or have an unnamed rank within it (Art. 35). In publications issued when the family group did not exist (e.g., prior to 1802) or in those where family group names are not accepted, any rank above genus group may be regarded as belonging to the family group. Names clearly attributed to a family-group rank but not based on a type genus name must also be considered, although only for rejection.</p>

If the name appears in different ranks, the highest rank within the family-group has precedence (Article 24.1) as the origin; others must be mentioned in the Remarks field. Care should be taken not to confuse faulty (or non-standard) Latin with vernacular spelling. Consider also Articles 32.5.3.2 and 35.4.1 for names formed from incorrect subsequent spellings or unjustified emendations (but see Article 35.4.2).</p>
