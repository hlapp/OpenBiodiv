Being 900 km away from Iquitos, Peru (the site of the closest record), discovery of this species in the Lower Urubamba constitutes a significant range extension.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>Our understanding of the diversity and distributions of Neotropical porcupines of the <italic><tp:taxon-name><tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="species">vestitus</tp:taxon-name-part></tp:taxon-name></italic>-group has been very much thwarted by the lack of specimens and locality records. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Voss and da Silva (2001)</xref> discussed two hypotheses for why these diminutive species might be so rarely detected: 1) they might have very restricted distributions in western Amazonia, and 2) their apparent rarity might be an artifact of inadequate collection. In a recent methods paper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Gregory et al. (2014)</xref> demonstrated how specialized camera trapping methods can result in the documentation of a greater abundance of <italic><tp:taxon-name><tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="species">vestitus</tp:taxon-name-part></tp:taxon-name></italic>-group porcupines than might have been detected using conventional survey methods (<italic>sensu</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Voss and Emmons 1996</xref>) alone. Testing either of these hypotheses would begin with efforts to first map the known distribution of the species through the steady accumulation of point locality data. In this paper we report one such new locality record—and a significant range extension—for the recently described species <italic><tp:taxon-name><tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="genus">Coendou</tp:taxon-name-part> <tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="species">ichillus</tp:taxon-name-part></tp:taxon-name></italic>, which is here reported from the Lower Urubamba Region (LUR) of Peru.</p>
            <p><italic><tp:taxon-name><tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="genus">Coendou</tp:taxon-name-part> <tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="species">ichillus</tp:taxon-name-part></tp:taxon-name></italic> was previously known from six sight records and only five specimens—three collected from the Amazonian lowlands of eastern Ecuador, one from Iquitos, Peru, and the fifth of unverified natural origins that was purchased in a market in Iquitos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Voss 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Voss and da Silva 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Voss et al. 2013</xref>). The skulls of the specimens analyzed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Voss and da Silva (2001)</xref> exhibit damage that presumably occurred during the process of collecting and preparing these specimens, and none include postcranial elements beyond those left in the hands and feet of their respective study skins. Morphometric information was not provided for the specimen from Iquitos mentioned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Voss (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Voss et al. (2013)</xref> (TTU 115491). The specimen that forms the basis of our new record consists of a study skin, a skeleton, and an intact skull. To maximize the utility of the specimen, we cleaned the skeletal elements from one side of the study skin, while leaving the other side intact as a traditional study skin. We provide measurements and descriptions of these and compare them to the previously known specimens reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Voss and da Silva (2001)</xref>.</p>
            <p>In 2011, Gregory and colleagues began a study in the Lower Urubamba Region (LUR) of Peru assessing the effectiveness of natural canopy bridges (connections between the branches of large trees) over a ~15-meter-wide natural gas pipeline clearing in mitigating the ensuing canopy fragmentation. The study began before the natural bridges were exposed and continued through pipeline right-of-way (RoW) construction, revegetation, and eventual closure of the RoW to motorized vehicles. In September 2012, soon after the 13 natural bridges were exposed in July, camera traps were placed in the canopy at all potential crossing points. The 24 cameras were left for a year, and the photos revealed extensive small and medium-size mammal activity in the canopy, including thousands of photos of a dwarf porcupine species. With no dwarf porcupine species known to the area, the research team opted to attempt trapping a specimen for identification as the study concluded. One female specimen was collected.</p>
            <!--PageBreak-->
            <p>In this paper we report the range extension for this species, describe its morphology, comment on its behavior as revealed in the camera trap photos, and discuss the significance of the range extension. This is the second in a series of four papers that address the methods used and results from the three-year-long study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Gregory et al. 2014</xref>).</p>

            <p>The study site is in the Lower Urubamba Region, adjacent to the confluence of the Camisea and Urubamba Rivers (<named-content content-type="dwc:verbatimCoordinates">11°43.28'S, 72°56.52'W</named-content> (DDM), Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The study area is in predominantly primary forest between 450–500 m with three major habitat types: <italic>terra firme</italic>, riverine terrace, and mixed upland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Comiskey et al. 2001</xref>). It is near the Pluspetrol-controlled Pagoreni A natural gas well and the pipeline that connects the well to the Malvinas processing plant. The site is also near the Matsigenka communities of Camisea and Shivankoreni and is not part of the national system of protected areas, for which reason subsistence hunting of wildlife is legal.</p>

            <p>This study is part of a larger study aimed at understanding the utility of natural canopy bridges in reducing the forest fragmentation impact caused by a natural gas pipeline right-of-way (RoW) clearing. In order to evaluate natural bridge use by arboreal mammals, the 13 bridges were monitored with 24 Reconyx PC800 Hyperfire<sup>TM</sup> Professional (Reconyx Inc., Holmen, WI, USA) camera traps placed at all potential crossing points over the course of a year. An additional 28 camera traps were placed on the ground below the bridges and 26 more in a control area along the RoW with no canopy bridges. The branches comprising the bridges were left in July 2012, and monitoring occurred from September 2012, the middle of the pipeline construction period, to September/October 2013, approximately six months post construction. All behavioral data presented here were gathered from camera trap photos. Camera trap photographs were processed by a team of three people who separated the photos into trigger events and identified the vertebrates in each event. The information recorded for each event included the following: date and time, bridge, species present, number of individuals, behaviors exhibited, and moon phase.</p>
            <p>To evaluate activity hours of <italic><tp:taxon-name><tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="genus">Coendou</tp:taxon-name-part> <tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="species">ichillus</tp:taxon-name-part></tp:taxon-name></italic>, data from all cameras over the course of the year were pooled by hour of the day. For the moon phase analysis, data from all cameras were pooled by moon phase for each lunar cycle over the course of 13 cycles. Waning and waxing moon phases with similar amounts of moonlight were pooled for the analysis for a total of 5 moon phase categories: 0 = new moon, 1 = waxing and waning crescent, 2 = first and last quarters, 3 = waxing and waning gibbous, and 4 = full moon. The number of events per hour of the day and per moon phase category per lunar cycle were divided by the corresponding number of camera trap nights and multiplied by 100, for analysis of event rates. A Spearman’s correlation was performed on the moon phase data for the 13 lunar cycles through which the study occurred to explore the relationship between activity and phase.</p>

            <p>Porcupine specimen collection took place in October 2013. Six Tomahawk (20 × 60 × 20 cm) traps were placed in the mid-canopy over 12 days (trapping methods will be described in detail in Gregory, in prep.). Each Tomahawk trap was monitored with a camera trap.</p>
            <!--PageBreak-->
            <p>The specimen described here was captured on the first day of trapping at 2:26AM (determined by camera trap photo) in a trap at 17.5 m in height (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The trap had been baited with a section of wood soaked in salt water and a mixture of canned tuna, oatmeal, tomato paste, and fresh tomato. There was no sign of any remaining bait when the individual was captured. The camera trap documented the individual consuming the bait.</p>

            <p>The morning after the specimen was trapped, it was immediately transported in the trap back to the research camp. The entire trap was placed in a large plastic bag with isoflurane-soaked cotton in one corner, out of contact with the animal. After the animal was subdued, it was injected with sodium pentobarbital (6 mL injected into the chest and 2 mL injected into the cranium). The specimen was identified as a female with developed, turgid nipples and a closed vagina. The skin was then prepared and the body was placed in alcohol. Tissue samples, quills, fleas, feces, and stomach contents were also collected. The specimen was deposited at the Centro de Biología y Biodiversidad (CORBIDI, MA-00973) in Lima, Peru, and then borrowed and transported to the United States. Maceration and cleaning of the carcass and cranium and morphometric analyses were performed at the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH). A portion of each tissue sample was deposited at NMNH (USNM 599500).</p>
            <p>All reported measurements are in millimeters (mm). External measurements of the specimen that constitutes our new record are those that were recorded in the field by the collector. Cranio-dental measurements are those defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Voss and da Silva (2001)</xref>; long-bone measurements are greatest total length. All osteological measurements were recorded to the nearest 0.1 mm using digital calipers at NMNH.</p>

Behavioral inferences drawn from the photos (i.e. animals searching for the best branch by which to cross) and data recorded on the characteristics of the bridges suggest that the only bridges not used were those without direct contact between the branches that composed the bridge. Lack of saltatory ability is therefore likely to have prevented use of these bridges.</p>
            <p>There were 379 total camera trapping events (2,196 photos) of <italic><tp:taxon-name><tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="genus">Coendou</tp:taxon-name-part> <tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="species">ichillus</tp:taxon-name-part></tp:taxon-name></italic> over 7,198 trap nights for a rate of 5.3 events/100 trap nights. To identify the number of individuals captured during these events, we carefully analyzed the photos, using identifying characteristics to distinguish between individuals. Our count of the total number of individuals was conservative, accounting for the possibility that close proximity between bridges and favorable topography would allow individuals to be photographed in more than one bridge. In total, we counted 17 individuals, including one juvenile. While adult males and females were not distinguishable, during 11 of the trapping events, two individuals were recorded together. During five of these events (all in the same bridge), one individual was significantly smaller than the other, suggesting it was a mother and juvenile. During the other six events (in two bridges), both animals seemed to be adults and may have been a male and female (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7c</xref>).</p>

            <p>Pathologies recorded in the photographs include botfly wounds or lumps on the right and left rear paws and a broken tail.

            <p>In addition to providing measurements of long bones in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, some additional comments on the overall condition of the bony elements are warranted. The animal appears to have suffered injuries in life that, although healed, are readily apparent on the specimen. There is a healed fracture on the left zygoma, which is slightly indented compared to the normal right side. There are also apparently related distortions to the rostrum, which is somewhat asymmetrical in dorsal view and twisted to the animals’ right side. Finally, the animal appeared to have lost, during its lifetime, the part of the last phalange bearing the claw on the third digit of its left foot. This toe was observed in the field as being clawless but healed over at the time of capture.</p>

            <p>The vertebral column of our specimen (CORBIDI-MA-00973) presents seven cervical vertebrae, of which C 2-4 were fused. There were 15 thoracic vertebrae with 15 <!--PageBreak-->pairs of ribs, six lumbar vertebrae as defined by a conspicuous transverse process, three fused sacral vertebrae, and 29 caudal vertebrae. Greatest lengths of long bones from the left side of the animal are provided in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.</p>

All previous unambiguous records of the species were from the Amazonian lowlands of eastern Ecuador and Iquitos, Peru (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), our new record extends the range of the species approximately 900 km further south into the Peruvian Amazon. This unambiguous record of <italic><tp:taxon-name><tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="genus">Coendou</tp:taxon-name-part> <tp:taxon-name-part taxon-name-part-type="species">ichillus</tp:taxon-name-part></tp:taxon-name></italic> from the Lower Urubamba Region of Peru confirms that this species has a much wider distribution outside of eastern Ecuador and northeastern Peru.</p>
