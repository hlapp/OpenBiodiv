                <p><italic>Gramastacus lacus</italic> <bold>sp. n.</bold>, is described from coastal lowlands of the Central and Mid North Coast regions of New South Wales, Australia. <italic>Gramastacus lacus</italic> has a restricted distribution in ephemeral habitats, being dependent on regular natural flooding and drying cycles, and burrows for survival during temporary dry cycles. Documented are population distributions in lowland habitats (3–48 m, a.s.l.) from Wamberal Lagoon, north along the coastal strip to Wallis Lake. The species is small, reaching a maximum weight of 7 grams and 21.3 mm OCL, and distinguished by a large male genital papilla, large raised post orbital ridges, laterally compressed carapace and elongated chelae.</p>

            <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus lacus</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n., first came to my attention in 1984 when specimens were collected from the Ramsar Wetlands of Myall Lakes National Park for aquaculture trials. Since 2005 the Australian Crayfish Project (ACP) has been surveying eastern Australia to increase the knowledge base of all freshwater crayfish species. As part of this ongoing project, surveys of coastal New South Wales (NSW) over the last eight years have resulted in the discovery of isolated populations of this new <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus</tp:taxon-name></italic> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">–</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p>

In this paper I present a formal description of the new species, together with biological and distribution information.</p>

            <title>Methods</title>
            <p>Crayfish were collected using a variety of methods to suit the conditions at each survey site. Opera House traps (630 mm × 470 mm × 180 mm, 90 mm steel ring entrance hole) and box traps (430 mm × 260 mm × 260 mm, 50 mm steel ring entrance hole) were utilized, all baited with fresh fish. Scoop rakes and scoop nets were used to sample suitable sites with collection by hand used at many sites. Such collection included lifting structures like rocks and logs and excavating burrows, using hands and with the assistance of spades. Burrows were carefully and slowly excavated allowing the burrow and any branches to be followed. Careful burrow excavation provides information on species habitat requirements and burrow system structures.</p>
            <p>In an effort to better understand the biology of freshwater crayfish throughout their ranges and over time, voucher material for further study was retained where appropriate (to confirm the distribution and occurrence of a species at a certain place at a certain time). All retained specimens were placed in plastic transport containers with a small amount of water and returned alive to the laboratory. Specimens were photographed and examined in the laboratory under dissecting microscopes; measured with digital calipers; and weighed to nearest gram. Specimens were euthanized by freezing for at least 24 hours and subsequently stored in clear, labelled specimen jars containing originally 70% ethanol (and now 100% ethanol to better preserve tissue integrity for our genetics collaborations with James Cook University and the Australian Museum). <!--PageBreak-->Additionally, tissue samples from live animals were retained in cell lysis buffer from selected specimens for subsequent DNA analysis, as part of the broader ACP via our Carnegie Museum of Natural History genetics program.</p>
            <p>Type material is deposited in the Australian Museum, Sydney (AM). Other voucher specimens are lodged in the ACP collection, the Australian Museum and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History (CMNH). Additionally, results of surveys are included in the Atlas of NSW Wildlife database.</p>
            <p>At each site, the geographic position co-ordinates and altitude were recorded using a Magellan Explorist 510 and 600 handheld GPS. Notes were taken on exact location details, landforms, aquatic vegetation and stream conditions. Water quality information (flow, pH, temperature, salinity, visibility, DO, conductivity and TDS) was also recorded at selected sites. All specimen measurements are given in millimetres and all weights in grams. Morphological abbreviations and measurements follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Morgan (1986)</xref>.</p>

                    <p>No intersexed individuals were recorded, all being clearly either male or female. The male genital papilla is large, being a distinguishing character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Riek 1972</xref>) from other crayfish species in the region. They are opportunistic breeders, starting in early August being reliant on water availability in their ephemeral habitats, only breeding when flooded. Females mature at approximately 12 mm OCL and are very fecund for their size: ACP 2318, 12.3 mm OCL, September 2009, Myall Lakes, 44 eggs; ACP 2387, 13.08 mm OCL, September 2009, Myall Lakes, 29 eggs; ACP 2309, 15 mm OCL, August 2009, Lake Macquarie, 82 eggs; ACP 180, 15.93 mm OCL, August 2005, Myall Lakes, 79 eggs; ACP 2300, 16.74 mm OCL, August 2009, Lake Macquarie, 100 eggs; ACP 2307, 17.56 mm OCL, August 2009, Lake Macquarie, 143 eggs. Eggs are dark olive green colour (ACP 2318), to deep dark purple (ACP 2384). Berried females have previously been captured from water after rain events in August, September and October with approximately 30–150 eggs. Egg incubation is swift with a 6–8 week period between eggs laid and juveniles released. Females breeding in early September released juveniles in late October.</p>
                    <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus lacus</tp:taxon-name></italic> shows sexual dimorphism. Reproductively active females typically have broader abdomens with an abdominal anterolateral flap on the pleuron of abdominal somite 2 and have a smaller/narrower major cheliped then males. Reproductively active females are recorded between 12 and 18 mm OCL, but more research is needed (berried females over 18 mm OCL have not yet been recorded).</p>

            <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus lacus</tp:taxon-name></italic> is a small freshwater crayfish inhabiting lowland coastal environments between 3 and 48 m a.s.l. To date, it is known to occur from Wallis Lake in the north to Wamberal Lagoon in the south — a straight line distance of 165 km (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary material 1</xref>). Further south, suitable habitat occurs around Avoca and Cockrone Lagoons (<named-content content-type="dwc:verbatimCoordinates">33.4917°S, 151.4201°E</named-content>) but preliminary surveys have not yet identified the species presence. Further north, past Forster (<named-content content-type="dwc:verbatimCoordinates">32.0697°S, 152.5168°E</named-content>), suitable habitat is also present but the species remains unrecorded. Future field surveys may increase the known species distribution.</p>

            <p>Our research indicates that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus lacus</tp:taxon-name></italic> has specific habitat requirements, preferring ephemeral habitats (smaller creeks, swamps, wet areas and stump holes) that offer conditions that enable their survival and presumably limit threats from other predators, such as eels. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus lacus</tp:taxon-name></italic> populations were only found in ephemeral areas that reliably flood and then dry. Habitats in the same area that consist of permanent water invariably contain large numbers of freshwater eels (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Anguilla reinhardtii</tp:taxon-name></italic>) and native fish gudgeons (family <tp:taxon-name>Eleotridae</tp:taxon-name>) but not <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus lacus</tp:taxon-name></italic>. Many ephemeral swamps and creeks can revert from dry beds to water bodies several metres deep when flooded. Eels and fish may penetrate into and temporarily visit some habitat areas but <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus lacus</tp:taxon-name></italic> takes refuge in the periphery, protected within the thick reeds and flooded grasses along the shallow edges, well away from the deeper water.</p>
            <p>Larger swamps, such as Boomeri Swamp, the type locality in the Ramsar Wetlands of the Myall Lakes National Park, will dry out completely and then flood with up to 1.5 m of water. Deep water over 1 m is usually devoid of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus</tp:taxon-name></italic> except occasional moulted individuals. The only <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus</tp:taxon-name></italic> observed in &gt;1 m of water are soft moulted animals, presumably they are seeking the deeper water away from the high density populations in the shallows to avoid cannibalism. We have not captured eels or fish from this swamp but giant water bugs (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Lethocerus insulanus</tp:taxon-name></italic>), turtles (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Chelodina longicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic>), lizards (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Physignathus lesueurii</tp:taxon-name></italic>) and birds all prey in deeper water making it a more dangerous habitat for the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus</tp:taxon-name></italic> crayfish.</p>
            <p>No quantitative data are available on abundance of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus lacus</tp:taxon-name></italic>. From our observations and sampling, however, I estimate that at suitable sites they were abundant with densities up to 35/m<sup>2</sup> commonly in shallow heavily reeded areas within protected National Parks like the Myall Lakes. In altered habitats and areas impacted by human activity, the population numbers of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus lacus</tp:taxon-name></italic> were low, at 1/10 m<sup>2</sup> around Budgewoi Lake.</p>
            <!--PageBreak--><!--PageBreak-->
            <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus insolitus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, unlike <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus lacus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, is a very small non-burrowing freshwater crayfish, being commensal with larger crayfish species, using their burrows to survive the seasonal drying of their habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Johnston and Robson 2009</xref>). <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus lacus</tp:taxon-name></italic> differs from its congener by being a robust, strong, burrowing species relying on its own burrow for extended survival during drying events. Burrows are relatively simple, with a single entrance and rounded cross-section, generally descending at a steep angle. Depth varies with soil types, but most have a single corridor, penetrating 450 to 750 mm, with older burrows having a small rounded base chamber. Deepest burrows observed extend down about one metre and generally reach the water table. The preferred lowland coastal areas generally have shallow water tables. Burrows are completely round and colloquially referred to as “bore holes”; they may be capped with mud but are generally open.</p>
            <p>Only one adult crayfish per burrow was observed. On several occasions (at Myall and Wyee), however, one small juvenile crayfish was found with the adult. Unlike, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus insolitus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus lacus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, does not utilise the burrows of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cherax</tp:taxon-name></italic> species, and generally other crayfish species are not found within the main habitat areas. In the northern distribution of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus lacus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, the species was found in sympatry with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cherax setosus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, occasionally with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Euastacus reductus</tp:taxon-name></italic> at the limits of its distribution. Typically in small intermittent streams, only <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus lacus</tp:taxon-name></italic> is found downstream in smaller/shallower burrows where the water tables are shallow, and only <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cherax setosus</tp:taxon-name></italic> is found upstream in much larger deeper burrows with a 20 m intermix zone between where both occur within burrows less than 200 mm apart. Unfortunately, translocated <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cherax destructor</tp:taxon-name></italic> exist amongst the Wamberal Lagoon population of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus lacus</tp:taxon-name></italic> and I have grave fears for its future, with the outbreak of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cherax destructor</tp:taxon-name></italic> being an ongoing significant threat to that population of native <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">McCormack in press</xref>).</p>
            <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus lacus</tp:taxon-name></italic> possesses large elongated chelae that are used quite effectively in water to defend themselves and ward off attack from other crayfish, small fish or macroinvertebrates. When submerged they will raise their open claws and wave them rapidly about in defence. However, they are seemingly rarely used for defence out of water. Crayfish are easily handled and will rarely nip when handled. Chelae are long and ungainly out of water, possibly being difficult to raise and hold extended. Individuals tend to rapidly lower their claws and retreat, preferring to avoid confrontation. In backwards retreat, the crayfish will drag the claws or use them in a series of claw over claw pushing motions to help them move more rapidly. If the crayfish moves forward, then it has two types of movement. Firstly, it will individually, alternatingly raise a claw, extend and lower it whilst moving forward till it reaches the claw tips then lift it up and extend it again. This coordinated claw over claw movement is usually only used at the start of the movement then the crayfish generally changes to a more unusual movement that may be easier or more efficient. Secondly, there is a unique forward movement via a series of rhythmic plunges. The crayfish raises the cephalothorax and both claws up with its legs and then moves forward overbalancing and plunges down and forward then repeats the movement. This up and forward movement is unusual, but the crayfish easily moves up, forward and down without “missing a beat”.</p>
            <p>Unlike many Australian freshwater crayfish, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus lacus</tp:taxon-name></italic> is not known to be subject to temnocephalan infestation, with no records from any sampled populations. Notably, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cherax destructor</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cherax setosus</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Euastacus reductus</tp:taxon-name></italic> captured together with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gramastacus lacus</tp:taxon-name></italic> have had healthy populations of temnocephalans. I feel that this is a significant facet of biological information that needs further research. Also noteworthy was one specimen ACP 4122 (in the vicinity of the type locality) with two eggs from an unidentified species attached to the lateral posterior of the carapace.</p>

            <p>Further research into the genetics of each catchment population should be a priority. Other than minor setal variation on the first chelipeds, no consistent morphological differences could be identified between populations even though each population seems geographically separated, and some by large marine water barriers, such as the Hunter River and Port Stephens. The degree of genetic connectivity between populations is not yet known. I suspect that populations have been isolated through habitat fragmentation and may be highly divergent and genetically distinct, containing unique haplotypes. If so, these could represent different evolutionary significant units (ESUs) or conservation management units (MUs) that might require individual conservation attention, especially because an important goal of species conservation is to preserve genetic diversity.</p>
            <p>As the species occurs along the coastal strip in some of the fastest developing areas of Australia, further field surveying to identify isolated populations should also be a priority, with an assessment of the conservation status of each population as currently nearly all are potentially endangered.</p>
