#### Preamble

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. It allows for
the mixing of source code and documentation.

#### Generating RDF from marked-up text

We're using the `obkms` and the `rdf4jr` R libraries (not yet published). The 
`obkms` library deals with the creation of RDF, while the `rdf4jr` library
deals with the communication with a
[GraphDB](http://ontotext.com/products/graphdb/) instance (our triplestore).

```{r}
library(obkms)
library(rdf4jr)
```

Before we begin, we need to supply the access data. Access data can be read from
a YAML configuration file. Note: the password is not stored in the configuration
file. The user-password needs to be read from the environment variable
`OBKMS_SECRET`. After we read the configuration we need to setup an environment
where the functions are continuously going to look for the access credentials.
We do this with the package `init_env` function.

```{r}
configuration_file = "/home/viktor/Work/OBKMS/etc/config.yml"
server_access_options = yaml::yaml.load_file( configuration_file )
server_access_options$userpwd = Sys.getenv("OBKMS_SECRET")
init_env(server_access_options)
```

The `obkms` library has lots of functions:
```{r}
?obkms
```

If you want to convert an XML file to RDF, you use the `xml2rdf` function.
Currently, only the `TaxPub` XMl schema and Turtle serialization of RDF is supported.

```{r}
example_taxpub = "/home/viktor/Work/OBKMS/Tests/BDJ373/10.3897_BDJ.4.e7713.xml"
turtle = xml2rdf( example_taxpub )
cat(turtle)
```

Now we can submit the Turtle to the system:

```{r}
processing_status = httr::content( rdf4jr::add_data(server_access_options, server_access_options$repository, turtle), as="text" ) 
```
